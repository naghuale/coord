# AIAG-09: Подключить nightly evaluation profile

## Goal

Scheduled profile runs public/adversarial suites without side effects.


## Planning estimate

```yaml
priority: P1
gitlabWeight: 5
complexityRange: 5-8
estimateType: relative_points
confidence: medium
reestimateWhen:
  - scope changes
  - external dependency changes
  - accepted norm changes
  - provider or GitLab capability differs from assumption
```

> `gitlabWeight` is a relative planning value, not elapsed time. The range records uncertainty; GitLab stores the single lower-bound weight.

## Required metadata

decisionClass: TD
priority: P1
milestone: M4-behavior
blockedBy: [AIAG-08]
